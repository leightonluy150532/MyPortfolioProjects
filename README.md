# MyPortfolioProjects


Hello, I am Leighton Enzo M. Luy

I am an information technology student at Ateneo de Davao University. I am currently a second-year Information Technology student, and have experienced programming and created projects in my first year as an Information Technology student. 

In my first year as an Information Technology student, I created some past projects, such as creating my first website in the ITC course with Sir Geralde, and learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Also learned to create an Inventory System, which is the Inventory System in Computer Programming 2 with Prof. Christopher Alviola, using the Java Programming language and in Python. 

I also learned the Python language, and I learned extensively about the fundamentals of Python throughout my first year as an Information Technology student, which I have saved in my Python Projects. 

Some skills I gained throughout my First Year:  C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


Here are my projects in my first year as an Information Technology student.

Thank you for visiting!
